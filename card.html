			<p>The giant panda, also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear
    		           native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black
			   patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
   		           The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda.</p>
